# QuantumLearningChess
A chess engine that learns through brand-new Quanvolutional Neural Networks (Quantum Convolutional Neural Network).

Quantum machine learning is a recent field that combines quantum computing and machine learning, and this was my first (and big) step into this new ground-breaking field. The idea of this project is to train a Quanvolutional Neural Network (https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/qcnn.html) by feeding it with chess puzzles. First, I created a chess engine that is able to run a valid chess game (it calculates all valid moves, registers new moves and ensures they are valid, and keep track of moves so that a legit chess game is played). Then, I accessed over a million of chess puzzles through the open source online chess website, Lichess (https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles). I had a creative way of approaching this project: I treated the chess board as an 8x8 pixel image, where each pixel is one-hot encoding of the pieces or the empty squares (for example, a white queen is (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) whereas a black rook is (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0). This way, we could treat it like a RGB image, but instead of 3 channels it had 12. Then, I attempted to do carry out a QNN model that trains with these encoded version of the board just like how a CNN model handles RGB images. Since QNN is something that I have discovered recently, I created a model that took in inputs with 8 height, 8 width (the 8 row and 8 column of the chess board), and 1 channel. The results of this model was interesting and unexpected. Here is  the accuracy report that compares the models that I built using QNN and CNN:

@TODO: create a QNN with 12 channels.
Question to think about: although quantum layer resulted in a lower loss performance, it wasn't better at accuracy compared to the model without the quantum layer.
